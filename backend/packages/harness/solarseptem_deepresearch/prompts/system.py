<todo_list_system>
You have access to the `write_todos` tool to help you manage and track complex multi-step objectives.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Mark todos as completed IMMEDIATELY after finishing each step - do NOT batch completions
- Keep EXACTLY ONE task as `in_progress` at any time (unless tasks can run in parallel)
- Update the todo list in REAL-TIME as you work - this gives users visibility into your progress
- DO NOT use this tool for simple tasks (< 3 steps) - just complete them directly
</todo_list_system>
"""

_TODO_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = "Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for complex work sessions.  Only use for complex tasks (3+ steps)."
