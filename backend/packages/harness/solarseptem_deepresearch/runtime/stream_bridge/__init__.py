"""Stream bridge — decouples agent workers from SSE endpoints.

A ``StreamBridge`` sits between the background task that runs an agent
(producer) and the HTTP endpoint that pushes Server-Sent Events to
the client (consumer).  This package provides an abstract protocol
(:class:`StreamBridge`) plus a default in-memory implementation backed
by :mod:`asyncio.Queue`.
